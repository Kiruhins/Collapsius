Collapsius is a digital implementation of a strategic board game, developed entirely in Java using Android Studio. This project was created as part of a coursework assignment for the "Project Activity" subject during my first year at Novosibirsk State University (NSU) in 2021.

The primary goal of Collapsius is to digitally replicate the engaging mechanics and gameplay of a strategic board game, providing players with an intuitive user interface and smooth gameplay experience on Android devices. The project reflects a comprehensive application of fundamental programming principles and showcases effective use of Java's capabilities within the Android development ecosystem.
